# coreR Course
Materials for coreR April 2023 session

## Contributing

1. Make a branch for the updates you want to do on a specific lesson (i.e. update-intro-git-github)
2. Save, pull, and push changes
3. When changes are final and ready for the main branch - set up a pull request (PR). If there are no merge conflicts, you can complete the PR

## Overall workflow
1. Always pull from main when you first open the project so you have the most up-to-date work
