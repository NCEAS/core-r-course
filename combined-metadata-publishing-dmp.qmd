## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

-   Understand the major components of a data management plan
-   Practice using metadata guidelines that are best for reproducibility
-   Become familiar with environmental data repositories for accessing and publishing data

## The Data Life Cycle

The data life cycle is a tool for facilitating successful management and preservation of data throughout a research project. Multiple versions of the data life cycle exist and vary in practice across domains or communities. For example, a meta-analysis project may only focus on the Discover, Integrate, and Analyze phases of the cycle.

:::

DataOne's [Data Management Skillbuilding Hub](https://dataoneorg.github.io/Education/bestpractices/) offers several best practices on how to effectively work with your data throughout all stages of the data life cycle.

## Writing Data Management Plans (DMPs)

A DMP is a document that describes how you will use your data during a research project, as well as what you will do with your data long after the project ends. Often a DMP encompasses all phases of the data life cycle - from planning, to collecting, to analyzing and ultimately to preservation and storage of the data.

These are important project aspects to deeply consider because a well-thought-out plan means you are more likely to:

-   stay organized,
-   work efficiently,
-   truly share data,
-   engage your team,
-   meet funder requirements as DMPs are become more common in the submission process for proposals.

A DMP is both a straightforward blueprint for how you manage your data, *and* provides guidelines for your and your team on policies, access, roles, and more. While it is important to plan, it is equally important to recognize that no plan is perfect as change is inevitable. To make your DMP as robust as possible, treat it as a "living document" that you periodically review with your team and adjust as the needs of the project change.

### How to Plan

-   **Plan early:** research shows that over time data loss
-   **Plan in collaboration:** high engagement of your team and stakeholders is not only a benefit to your project, but it also makes your DMP more resilient. When you include diverse expertise and perspectives to the planning stages, you're more likely to overcome obstacles in the future.
-   **Utilize existing resources:** don't reinvent the wheel! There are many great DMP resources out there. Consider the article *Ten Simple Rules for Creating a Good Data Management Plan* [@michener2015], which has succinct guidelines on what to include in a DMP. Or use an online tool like [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/), which provides official DMP templates from funders like NSF, example answers, and allows for collaboration.
-   **Make revising part of the process:** Don't let your DMP collect dust after your initially write it. Make revising the DMP part of your research project and use it as a guide to ensure you're keeping on track.
